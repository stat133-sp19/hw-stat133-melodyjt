###**Cooking Recipe**

![**Melting Potatoes**](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/812/27201919058_534eb7d0b7_z.jpg)

_Ingredients_  
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
* 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or rosemary leaves  
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
* 2 pounds yukon gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch slices  
* 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock or low-sodium broth  
* 3 to 4 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed

_Tools_  
* large bowl  
* 9x13 metal baking pan  
* thin spatula

_Steps_  
1. Heat oven to **500 degrees F** (_450 or 475 works as well_)  
2. Place melted butter in the bottom of the large bowl  
3. Stir in herbs, salt, and pepper (_none of these mandatory, place in what you want to season your potatoes_)  
4. Add potato slices and mix (_coat evenly_)  
5. Spread potato slices (_including everything in the bowl_) in the metal baking pan  
6. Roast potatoes for **15 minutes**  
7. Use the thin spatula to loosen potatoes and turn them over  
8. Roast for **15 _more_ minutes**  
9. Pour stock or broth into the pan and add the garlic cloves  
10. Roast for **15 minutes _more_** (_or until potatoes are fully tender_)  
11. Remove from oven and transfer into a serving platter (_including any remaining liquid in the pan_)  

_Extra Notes_  
* can be made any season  
* floury/mealy potatoes (_such as Russets_) also work  
* a little butter with olive works as a substitute for all 4 tablespoons of butter  

###**Euclidean Distance**  

####**Definition**
***  
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** =  ($\sf{p_{1}}, \sf{p_{2}},..., \sf{p_{n}}$) and **q** = ($\sf{q_{1}}, \sf{q_{2}},..., \sf{q_{n}}$) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagoran formula:

$\mathit{d}$$(\textbf{p, q})$ = $\mathit{d}$$(\textbf{q, p})$ =
$\sqrt{(q_{1} - p_{1})^2 + (q_{2} - p_{2})^2+ ... + (q_{n}-p_{n})^2)}$ =

$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n  (q_i - p_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean _n_-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, sarting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:<br>
$\|\textbf p\| = \sqrt{p_{1}^2 + p_{2}^2+ ... + p_{n}^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p.p}}$, <br>
where the last expression involves the dot product.
