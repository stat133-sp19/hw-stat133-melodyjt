### **Cooking Recipe**

![**Melting Potatoes**](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/812/27201919058_534eb7d0b7_z.jpg)

*Ingredients*
\* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
\* 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or rosemary leaves
\* 1 teaspoon kosher salt \* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
\* 2 pounds yukon gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch slices
\* 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock or low-sodium broth
\* 3 to 4 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed

*Tools*
\* large bowl
\* 9x13 metal baking pan
\* thin spatula

*Steps*
1. Heat oven to **500 degrees F** (*450 or 475 works as well*)
2. Place melted butter in the bottom of the large bowl
3. Stir in herbs, salt, and pepper (*none of these mandatory, place in what you want to season your potatoes*)
4. Add potato slices and mix (*coat evenly*)
5. Spread potato slices (*including everything in the bowl*) in the metal baking pan
6. Roast potatoes for **15 minutes**
7. Use the thin spatula to loosen potatoes and turn them over
8. Roast for **15 *more* minutes**
9. Pour stock or broth into the pan and add the garlic cloves
10. Roast for **15 minutes *more*** (*or until potatoes are fully tender*)
11. Remove from oven and transfer into a serving platter (*including any remaining liquid in the pan*)

*Extra Notes*
\* can be made any season
\* floury/mealy potatoes (*such as Russets*) also work
\* a little butter with olive works as a substitute for all 4 tablespoons of butter

### **Euclidean Distance**

#### **Definition**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = ($\\sf{p\_{1}}, \\sf{p\_{2}},..., \\sf{p\_{n}}$) and **q** = ($\\sf{q\_{1}}, \\sf{q\_{2}},..., \\sf{q\_{n}}$) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagoran formula:

*d*(**p, q**) = *d*(**q, p**) = $\\sqrt{(q\_{1} - p\_{1})^2 + (q\_{2} - p\_{2})^2+ ... + (q\_{n}-p\_{n})^2)}$ =

$\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^n (q\_i - p\_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, sarting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:<br> $\\|\\textbf p\\| = \\sqrt{p\_{1}^2 + p\_{2}^2+ ... + p\_{n}^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p.p}}$, <br> where the last expression involves the dot product.
